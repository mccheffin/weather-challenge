# AirDNA Front End Code Exercise

Hey there! We'd like you to work on a simple React app that fetches the weather forecast based on a user's location search input and displays the forecast in the UI. The API doesn't support CORS, so you'll find it [proxied](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development) through create-react-app. You can hit the API by making a request to `/api/...`.
The API you'll be using can be referenced here: [MetaWeather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)

There are 2 endpoints you'll need:

- **Location Search** - Finds a location from a search string
  - GET `/api/location/search/?query=${query}`
- **Location** - Returns location information and a 5-day forecast from a location ID
  - GET `/api/location/${locationId}/`

The temperature comes back from the API in celsius. You'll find a conversion function in `src/utils/conversions`

Please don't spend more than 2-3 hours. We're looking for how you approach problems, architect a feature, and write production-grade code.  The UI should be responsive and use modern CSS practices, but doesn't need to be visually impressive. Some priorities:

1. Working location search and fetching of weather data
2. Handle errors within the code and UI (for example, search returns no results)
3. Extended forecast displayed in UI

When you have completed this please push to a repo on Github (or Gitlab) and either send us a public link or add `ndstephens` as a collaborator if you'd rather make the repository private.
